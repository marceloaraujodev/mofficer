  if you have access to shoppify admin, you can set up webhooks so that every time a product is added/updated, shopify notifies your script


  1. Get Shopify API Access

    • Ask the customer for API credentials (or have them create a Private App in Shopify).
    • You need access to:
      read_products
      write_products (if modifying data)


  2. Create a Shopify Webhook

    • In Shopify Admin:
      • Go to Settings > Notifications.
      • Scroll down to Webhooks.
      • Click Create Webhook.
      • Set Event = "Product update"
      • Set URL = https://mofficer.vercel.app/api/generateFeed
      • Set Format = JSON
    • Now, every time a product changes, Shopify will send data to your API.
